.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
This class implements a z-domain filter on a specified array of float32's (a\&.k\&.a\&. singles, floats)\&. It requires the transfer function coefficients be already calculated (i\&.e\&., it does not generate the coefficients based on desired filter characteristics)\&. MATLAB and its Signal Processing Toolbox can be used to generate the coefficients\&.
.PP
While this class is designed to implement a single-section filter, several instances of the class can be created and run over the data array in sequence to effectively implement a multi-section filter\&.

\fIdiffEq\fP a vector containing two vectors of float32's (a\&.k\&.a\&. singles, floats), that contains the numerator and denominator coefficients, respectively, of the z-domain tranfer function of the filter in decending order (z^0, z^-1, z^-2, etc\&.)\&.
